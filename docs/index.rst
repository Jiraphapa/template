trajectory_planning_helpers module documentation
==================================================
This repository provides some helper functions we frequently use in our trajectory planning software stack at FTM/TUM. Many of the functions are based on third order splines because we use them as a basis for our path planning. Please keep in mind that some of the functions are designed to work on a closed (race-) track and might therefore not work properly on a common street network.
