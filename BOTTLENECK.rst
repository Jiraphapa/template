Performance & Bottleneck Analysis
================================

The bottleneck analysis is a crucial step required for the performance optimization. Since it is stated that deterministic profiling can be highly precise, however, its overhead may affect its accuracy while statistical profiling has less overhead but lower precision in comparison, both profiling methods are applied.  The following tools and methods are applied to achieve the bottleneck analysis milestone.
