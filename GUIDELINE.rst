Guidelines For Further Development
================================

Potential Approach 
--------
As seen in the Performance Evaluation section, some modules can be optimized to achieve up to 50.9762% decrease in computation while another 
one may yield only 7.61145% improvement. With Numba alone the performance varies depend on the structure of the code.

Frequent Issues and Troubleshooting
--------
Several issues and errors are encountered during the development and below are the approaches for commonly found errors:
